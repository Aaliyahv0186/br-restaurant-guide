## Task 0: Getting Started

1. Partner up. One person needs to fork this repo and add the other partner as a collaborator.
2. You both need to clone the forked repo into `~/workspace`. 

This will be the workflow for most _(but not all)_ pair activities.  `Git` used to it!

## Task 1: Study the directory structure

2. Explore the folders and the files inside of them.
